Just a clean architecture app, to get trailers and informations of movies, series and TV shows, made with [Getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get), [omdb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and Flutter sdk.

The main goal is to build readble, maintainable, testable, and high-quality flutter app using test-driven-design styled architecture (Inspired by [Reso Coder](https://resocoder.com/)).

‚úÖ You can learn how to implement the architecture here: [TDD Clean Architecture for Flutter](https://github.com/ResoCoder/flutter-tdd-clean-architecture-course)
